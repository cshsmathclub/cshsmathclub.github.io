    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This test consists of 25 questions. These questions are similar in topic and style to the ones you will see
            on March 27th.</li>
        <li>On the real exam, you are only allowed to use a writing utensil, scratch paper, and your big brain. However,
            on this practice exam, you can use whatever resources you wish to use.</li>
        <li>The problems are not necessarily in order of difficulty.</li>
        <li>If you don't know how to do a problem, don't look at the solution right away. Try some different things
            first.</li>
        <li>Most importantly, be creative, and have fun. The most important thing is that you exercise your brain
            thinking about these problems-- even if you get them wrong, the time spent thinking is very valuable.</li>
    </ul>
