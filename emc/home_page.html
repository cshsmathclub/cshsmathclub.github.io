        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>What is the purpose of the EMC Math Contest?</b><br />Our school's math club decided to hold the EMC contest in 2019 as a way of exciting young students about the field of math. Specifically, we wanted to expose elementary age students to the creative problem solving and critical thinking aspects of mathematics that they don't often get to see through school alone. We believe that with exciting experiences like this at an early age, students can come to actively enjoy math, instead of seeing it as a chore.</li>
            <li><b>What will the exam contain?</b><br />The exam will be roughly 20 questions. Answers to questions will be a single number (they will not be multiple choice, nor will students be required to submit explanations or work). Problems on the exam will range from simple calculations to word problems and other types of questions that require students to creatively approach solutions. When writing problems for the exam, we make sure to include ONLY topics that students learn in 3rd and/or 4th grade math courses in school-- we try to incorporate elements of creativity and critical thinking into problems that can be solved with the math that 3rd and 4th graders have learned in school.</li>
            <li><b>Where and how will the contest be held?</b><br />This year, our math club has chosen to run the contest online. We are currently putting together a submission system through which students can take the exam online. A practice exam will open up on March 13th for students to both test out our testing platform and get a feel for the type of questions we may ask on the exam.</li>
            <li><b>What prizes will be given out?</b><br />While the exact awards we give out will be based on the number of students who eventually register, we can ensure that we will at least give out prizes for the top 3 students in each grade level, as well as the highest overall scoring boy and highest overall scoring girl.</li>
            <li><b>How do I register for the contest?</b><br />The link at the top of the page will lead you to registration.</li>
