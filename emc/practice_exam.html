                    <p>This can be done two ways. The brute-force way is to write out a bunch of numbers starting from 1

                        when you reach 45 total. Using this method, we see that \(1+2+3+...+9 = 45\), so the answer is

                        to 100, that would take forever! Instead, we can observe that the sum of the first \(n\) numbers
                        is \(\frac{n\times(n+1)}{2}\). For example,
                        the sum of the first 5 numbers is \(\frac{5\times6}{2} = 15\), and the sum of the first 100
                        numbers is \(\frac{100\times101}{2} = 5050\). To see how long it
                        takes Mr. Tyler to reach 45 questions, we see that the sum of the first \(\textcolor{green}{9}\)
                        numbers is 45.

                        a <i>huge</i> number, our calculation is easy. Also, we see that the unit digits as we multiply
                        them form a

                        numbers in this pattern and find that the unit digit of \(7^{12}\) is \(\textcolor{green}{1}\).

                    <p>If we simply add up 50 and 90, we get 140 people. That's more people than there are in the class!
                        This is because
                        we counted each person who voted for both a snake and a hamster twice. Since we know that there
                        are 100 people in the class,
                        we find out how many people we ``double-counted" by subtracting the class size from the sum of
                        the votes for snake and hamster.

                        Alternate Explanation: Since we know that 10 did not vote for hamster, those 10 had to vote for
                        only snake. Since we know there were only 10
                        from the snake group that voted only snake, the rest had to have voted hamster and snake.
